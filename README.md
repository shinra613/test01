# Flutter Task Manager App

## Overview
Welcome to the Flutter Task Manager App. This simple and efficient application, built using Google's Flutter framework, is designed for quick task management. Ideal for personal or professional use, it provides a user-friendly interface to add, display, and delete tasks on-the-go. Note that this app is currently session-based, meaning all tasks are temporary and will be lost upon closing the app.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can easily add tasks into the app.
- **Display Tasks**: Tasks are displayed in an easy-to-read list format.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks from the list as they are completed or no longer needed.

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: This app is developed using Flutter, ensuring compatibility with both iOS and Android platforms.
- **State Management**: It leverages Flutter's state management system to manage user interactions and UI updates.
- **No Persistent Storage**: The app doesn't currently implement any persistent storage; tasks are only stored temporarily for the session's duration.
